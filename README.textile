h1. IIT Kanpur firewall authentication

h2. LaunchAgent for Mac OS X

This launchd script ensures that the firewall authentication python script (written by "sid0":http://bitbucket.org/sid0) keeps running in the background.
As long as the network is up, launchd will keep the script running. No more "keep this webpage open in the browser" nonsense.

h2. Setup

# If you haven't already, get the @firewall-auth.py@ script from "http://bitbucket.org/sid0/firewallauth":http://bitbucket.org/sid0/firewallauth
# Put it somewhere nice and don't move it from that location.
# Now, open the @in.pratul.firewallauth.plist@ file.
# In it, edit the firewallauth script file location (remember where you put it?), your firewall username, your firewall password and save it.
# Copy this plist file to @/Users/yourusername/Library/LaunchAgents/@
# Make a file called @.launchd.conf@ in your home folder. (which is @/Users/yourusername/@, of course)
# Open it and put this line in it and save it: <pre>load /Users/yourusername/Library/LaunchAgents/in.pratul.firewallauth.plist</pre>
# Open a terminal, run @launchctl@.
# On the launchd% prompt, type this: <pre>load /Users/yourusername/Library/LaunchAgents/in.pratul.firewallauth.plist</pre>
# That's it. You're done. @launchd@ will now ensure that you're always authenticated to the firewall.
